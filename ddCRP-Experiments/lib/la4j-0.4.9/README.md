[la4j (Linear Algebra for Java)](http://la4j.org)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vkostyukov/la4j.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vkostyukov/la4j)
=============================
![la4j logo](https://raw.github.com/vkostyukov/la4j/master/la4j-logo.png) 

The [**la4j**](http://la4j.org) is open source and **100% Java** library 
that provides **Linear Algebra** primitives (matrices and vectors) and algorithms. The **la4j** was initially designed 
to be lightweight and simple tool for passionate Java developers. It has been started as student project and turned into
one of the most popular Java packages for matrices and vectors.

The key features of the **la4j** are listed bellow:

* Great performance allied with beautiful design
* No dependencies and tiny size (~150kb jar)
* Fluent and object-oriented/functional API
* Sparse (CRS, CCS) and dense (1D/2D arrays) matrices and vectors
* Linear systems solving (Gaussian, Jacobi, Zeidel, Square Root, Sweep and other)
* Matrices decomposition (Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors, SVD, QR, LU, Cholesky and other)
* Functors support: predicates, functions, procedures and accumulators
* MatrixMarket/CSV IO formats support


Brief Examples
--------------
**Matrix inversion**
```java
// We want simple dense matrix that uses 2D array as internal representation
Matrix a = new Basic2DMatrix(new double[][] {
   { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 },
   { 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 },
   { 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 }
});

// We will use Gauss-Jordan method for inverting
MatrixInverter inverter = a.withInverter(LinearAlgebra.GAUSS_JORDAN);
// The 'b' matrix will be dense
Matrix b = inverter.invert(LinearAlgebra.DENSE_FACTORY);
```
**System of linear equations**
```java
// The coefficient matrix 'a' is a CRS (Compressed Sparse Row) matrix 
Matrix a = new CRSMatrix(new double[][] {
   { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 },
   { 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 },
   { 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 }
});

// A right hand side vector, which is simple dense vector
Vector b = new BasicVector(new double[] {
   1.0, 2.0, 3.0
});

// We will use standard Forward-Back Substitution method,
// which is based on LU decomposition and can be used with square systems
LinearSystemSolver solver = a.withSolver(LinearAlgebra.FORWARD_BACK_SUBSTITUTION);
// The 'x' vector will be sparse
Vector x = solver.solve(b, LinearAlgebra.SPARSE_FACTORY);
```
**Matrix decomposition**
```java
// We want simple dense matrix, which is based on 1D double array
Matrix a = new Basic1DMatrix(new double[][] {
   { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 },
   { 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 },
   { 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 }
});

// We will use LU decompositor
MatrixDecompositor decompositor = a.withDecompositor(LinearAlgebra.LU);
// The result should be treated as: L = lup[0], U = lup[1], P = lup[2]
Matrix[] lup = decompositor.decompose(LinearAlgebra.DENSE_FACTORY);
```
